## Hey there! 👋 I'm Jordyn Ojeda

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a **AI/ML Engineer** with a strong foundation in **software engineering**, and I'm deeply passionate about all things **AI, machine learning, and innovative problem-solving**. Whether it's building intelligent systems, contributing to research, or learning the latest tech, I'm always hungry to push boundaries and grow.

### 🔧 What I’m Working On
- Currently diving into **Kaggle competitions**, fine-tuning an **LLM**, and building a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) app in Streamlit**.
- Exploring **machine learning system design**, and playing around with **React Native** as part of a personal financial management app.
- Open to collaborations! Previously contributed to **MIRAGE**, an open-source research initiative run by **MedARC**, and I’m always excited to team up on AI/ML-related open-source projects.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect!
